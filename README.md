# Back-End Project Setup and Execution Guide

Welcome to the back-end of this project. This document provides a step-by-step guide to install, configure, and run the back-end application.

---

## **Overview**

This back-end project consumes the public API [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to provide data handling functionality. It does not use a database; instead, all data is fetched and manipulated through external API calls.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure the following software is installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (v7 or later) or **Yarn** (optional) - Installed with Node.js
- **Git** - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## **Installation Steps**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/back-end.git
cd back-end
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

OR

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables. A `.env.example` file is provided for reference.

Example `.env`:

```env
# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
```

---

## **Running the Application**

### **Development Mode**

To start the server in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Production Mode**

1. Build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the server in production mode:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## **API Documentation**

This project consumes the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). Refer to the official documentation for endpoint details.

---

## **Testing**

Run the test suite to ensure the application is working correctly:

```bash
npm test
```

For tests with coverage:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

```

---

## **Common Issues**

### 1. **Port Already in Use**
If the default port is already in use, change the `PORT` variable in the `.env` file or stop the other service running on the same port:

```bash
lsof -i :3000 # Check the process using the port
kill -9 <PID> # Stop the process
```

### 2. **API Connection Error**
Ensure the external API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) is reachable. If there is an issue, verify your internet connection or check the API's availability.
